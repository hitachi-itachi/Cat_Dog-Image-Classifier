## Data Preprocessing

### Converting image to greyscale

Basically this code converts my image to greyscale.So it would be less computationally taxing and simplify the algorithm needed for this project.

### Making sure the Image are equal size:

All Image are of different sizes we have to make sure that all image are of equal sizes to eliminate any abnormalites that may show up during the training/testing phase.
